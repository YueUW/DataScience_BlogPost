# DataScience_BlogPost

Motivation: 
This project is my first data science project to help me get started with the workflow and posting. I chose Seattle(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/version/2#listings.csv) and Boston(https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) open data as database and did analysis on affecting factors of listing price and customer rating. Project blog is published on medium(https://medium.com/@zy83619/be-a-smart-airbnb-owner-in-seattle-7e4ed855d537) 

Files:
Main.ipynb: the python notebook that realize the main function
listings_boston.csv: Airbnb listings in Boston
listings_seattle.csv: Airbnb listings in Seattle

Libraries:
Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn

Summary:
Three business questions are answered based on analysis. As a conlusion, the listing price mainly affected by location of the property, both in Seattle and Boston. Property type, room type and number of bedrooms also contributes. In terms of customer rating, the value and cleanliness are the top two factor that correlates the total score. Results are visulaized and presented in the blog.
